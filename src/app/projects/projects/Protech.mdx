## Overview

Protech – Face Recognition Attendance Monitoring System is a smart attendance platform developed for schools and educational institutions. Designed to ensure student safety and streamline daily attendance, the system uses a live video feed and facial recognition to automatically detect and record student arrivals. Upon successful identification, the system sends real-time SMS and email notifications to parents or guardians. Admins can monitor attendance remotely from any device, and the platform provides a secure, accurate, and scalable solution for modern school environments. Developed as part of a capstone project, Protech combines robust backend architecture with intuitive UI for both staff and administrators.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Facial Recognition**: Detects student faces via live camera feed using DeepFace, with accurate identity verification and timestamp logging.
- **Automated Parent Notifications**: Sends SMS and email alerts to parents immediately upon a student's arrival.
- **Real-Time Attendance Tracking**: Dashboards display live attendance status per section, class, or school-wide.
- **Teacher Portal**: View class-specific attendance reports, monitor late/absent students, and receive real-time logs for their advisory sections.
- **Admin Portal**: Manage user accounts, student records, system configurations, and generate comprehensive reports across all classes.
- **Principal Portal**: Access school-wide analytics and attendance summaries by section, teacher, or grade level.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for teachers, admins, and principals to ensure data security and relevant access.
- **Daily and Monthly Reports**: Exportable attendance data by date range, class, or individual student, with filtering options.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Accessible from desktop, tablet, or mobile devices with consistent user experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: Login system using Django Auth with session handling and access control.
- **Attendance Logging**: Securely records time-stamped attendance data into the system’s database with student identity validation.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Admins can manage and monitor attendance from desktops, tablets, or smartphones.
- **Data Reporting**: View attendance logs and generate reports for specific students, dates, or classes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive UI optimized for both mobile and desktop usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework for handling core logic, data processing, and RESTful API endpoints.
- **Python**: Primary language for backend and facial recognition logic.
- **DeepFace**: Deep learning model used for real-time facial recognition and identity matching.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing student records, attendance logs, and notification logs.
- **HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS**: For building responsive and modern frontend interfaces.
- **JavaScript + AJAX**: For asynchronous, real-time interaction between frontend and backend.
- **Django Auth**: For secure user authentication and role management.
- **AWS**: For hosting, storage, and deployment infrastructure.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project collaboration.



## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included integrating the DeepFace model with live video processing and ensuring fast, reliable facial detection with varying lighting and movement conditions. Sending real-time SMS and email notifications required careful integration with third-party APIs and queue management. Additionally, securing the platform and managing user roles using Django's authentication system involved thoughtful planning. UI/UX design with Tailwind also posed a learning curve, especially for responsive design across devices. These challenges led to a deeper understanding of facial recognition models, real-time data handling, asynchronous frontend-backend communication, and secure user access control.

## Outcome

Protech was successfully deployed as a working capstone project and tested in a school-like environment. It achieved reliable student attendance tracking with minimal errors, improved parental communication, and demonstrated strong potential for real-world implementation. The system proved to be scalable, efficient, and user-friendly—providing both technical and practical value in automating school attendance processes.
