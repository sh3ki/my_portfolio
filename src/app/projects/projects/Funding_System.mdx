## Overview

Barangay Funding System is a desktop-based financial management application developed specifically for barangay treasurers, captains, and administrative staff. Built using Java and MySQL, the system provides a reliable and secure solution for recording, monitoring, and reporting on barangay-level income and expenses. Designed to run on local machines within barangay offices, it allows for offline functionality while maintaining structured and transparent access to critical financial data. With real-time updates, organized reporting tools, and user-friendly navigation, the Barangay Funding System supports efficient public fund management and promotes accountability in local governance.

## Key Features

- **Income and Expense Tracking**: Allows users to record and categorize all financial transactions, including official income sources and barangay expenditures.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Ensures that financial entries and reports reflect the latest records without delay.
- **Transparent Financial Reporting**: Automatically generates monthly, quarterly, and annual reports for council presentations or audit reviews.
- **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are assigned based on user roles (e.g., treasurer, captain, admin), limiting access to sensitive data as needed.
- **User Management**: Admins can add, edit, or deactivate users to maintain system integrity.
- **Printable Reports**: Generates exportable and printable summaries of fund usage for accountability and public display.
- **Simple Local Installation**: Designed for desktop use in barangay offices, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or web hosting.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks user activity for accountability and change tracking.
- **Budget Allocation Module**: (Optional) Supports planned budgets and comparisons against actual expenditures.
- **Multi-Device Compatibility (Desktop/Laptop)**: Runs on Windows-compatible machines across various barangay offices.




## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Primary programming language used to develop the applicationâ€™s core functionalities and user interface.
- **Java Swing/JavaFX**: For building the graphical desktop interface and user interaction components.
- **MySQL**: Local relational database used for securely storing financial records, user data, and transaction history.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Handles data transactions between the Java application and the MySQL database.
- **JasperReports**: For generating printable reports and exporting financial summaries to PDF or Excel.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control, team collaboration, and maintaining code history during development.



## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges in building the Barangay Funding System was designing a reliable financial tracker that works without internet connectivity while ensuring data consistency across multiple user sessions. Handling secure authentication, proper transaction logging, and report generation in a standalone environment required thoughtful planning of the data schema and user access controls. Through this project, we gained practical experience in building robust desktop applications, designing intuitive financial workflows, and implementing security within an offline architecture.

## Outcome

The Barangay Funding System was successfully deployed in a simulated local governance setting and received positive feedback for its usability, performance, and relevance. It significantly improved the tracking and reporting of barangay funds, reduced manual paperwork, and increased the transparency of financial operations. Tailored for the day-to-day needs of barangay officials, this system provides a scalable and dependable tool for promoting financial accountability at the grassroots level.
