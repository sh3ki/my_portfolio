## Overview

EduManage – School Management System is an all-in-one digital platform designed to simplify and centralize school operations through dedicated portals for students, teachers, principals, and administrators. Built with a focus on efficiency and accessibility, EduManage offers a wide range of tools to support academic workflows, including enrollment management, grading systems, lesson tracking, and real-time announcements. With role-specific dashboards and responsive multi-device access, the system empowers educational institutions to manage daily activities, monitor performance, and foster effective communication across the entire school community.


## Key Features

- **Student Portal**: Students can view class schedules, grades, assignments, and receive school announcements in a clean and organized interface.
- **Teacher Portal**: Teachers can manage courses, upload lessons and assignments, track student progress, and enter grades.
- **Principal Dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of academic activities, teacher performance, and school-wide reports.
- **Admin Panel**: Centralized control for managing users, scheduling classes, handling enrollments, and maintaining school data records.
- **Enrollment Management**: Automates student registration and class enrollment processes with verification and status tracking.
- **Grading & Assessment Tools**: Enables teachers to enter, modify, and analyze student grades efficiently.
- **Class Scheduling**: Allows administrators to create and manage timetables, assigning teachers and students to specific periods and rooms.
- **Announcements & Notifications**: Real-time announcements pushed to all users or specific roles to enhance internal communication.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Generates performance reports, attendance records, and enrollment statistics for better decision-making.
- **Multi-Role Access**: Distinct interfaces and access levels for students, teachers, principals, and admins.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Fully functional and accessible across desktops, tablets, and smartphones for on-the-go access.
- **Secure Login System**: Role-based authentication to ensure privacy and protect sensitive educational data.



## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Lightweight backend web framework used to build the system's core logic, APIs, and route handling.
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend development and business logic.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to store user data, grades, schedules, and system records.
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Tailwind**: Frontend tools used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript + AJAX**: Enables asynchronous updates for smoother user interactions without full-page reloads.
- **SMTP Integration**: For email notifications and announcements delivery to students, staff, or parents.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control, collaboration, and code management throughout development.



## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was creating a flexible system that accommodated diverse roles and permissions without causing conflicts in functionality. Designing a class scheduling system that allowed dynamic changes and conflict resolution between teacher and student availability required careful backend logic. Balancing the UI needs of multiple roles—from students to administrators—was also a key design challenge. Through overcoming these hurdles, we strengthened our backend development skills using Flask, improved our understanding of relational databases, and refined our ability to build secure, scalable, multi-role web applications.

## Outcome

EduManage was successfully implemented and tested in a simulated school environment, where it improved coordination between faculty, students, and administrative staff. The system proved effective in reducing manual paperwork, increasing transparency in grading and enrollment, and fostering better communication within the school. With its modular design and real-time capabilities, EduManage stands as a scalable and reliable solution for modern educational institutions aiming to digitize their operations and enhance student outcomes.
