## Overview

EcoTrack Vision – Environmental Monitoring System is a real-time monitoring platform developed to help organizations track key environmental factors such as waste bin levels, temperature, and other ecological indicators. Built using Django and PostgreSQL, the system offers automated data logging, threshold-based alerts, and insightful analytics to support sustainability initiatives and operational efficiency. Designed for use across desktops, tablets, and smartphones, EcoTrack Vision delivers a responsive, user-friendly experience that empowers both administrators and field personnel to monitor environmental data, identify inefficiencies, and make informed decisions for a greener future.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Continuously tracks environmental variables such as waste bin capacity, ambient temperature, humidity, or air quality depending on sensor integration.
- **Smart Alerts**: Sends automated notifications when specific thresholds are exceeded (e.g., full bin detected, temperature anomaly), enabling rapid response.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of live and historical environmental data with charts, graphs, and geolocation mapping (if applicable).
- **Data Logging & History**: Stores environmental readings over time for compliance, auditing, or performance review purposes.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generates weekly or monthly reports on environmental trends, efficiency metrics, and bin utilization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate views and permissions for environmental officers, technicians, and system admins.
- **Custom Threshold Configuration**: Allows administrators to set specific limits for alerts based on sensor type or location.
- **Device & Sensor Management**: Admin tools for registering and managing sensor-enabled devices in the system.
- **Mobile-Responsive Interface**: Accessible across various devices, ensuring field teams and management can monitor data on the go.
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses Django’s built-in authentication system with session management and CSRF protection.




## Technologies Used

- **Django (Python)**: Backend framework used to build the system logic, authentication, and RESTful APIs for data handling.
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced relational database system optimized for geospatial and time-series data logging.
- **HTML, CSS (Tailwind or Bootstrap)**: Used to design a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface.
- **JavaScript + AJAX**: Powers dynamic dashboard updates and real-time data visualization.
- **SMTP Integration**: Handles automated email notifications triggered by environmental thresholds.
- **Django Admin**: Provides a powerful out-of-the-box interface for managing data, users, and sensor configurations.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control, team collaboration, and deployment management.




## Challenges and Learnings

Developing EcoTrack Vision involved integrating sensor data into a live Django-based system while ensuring data accuracy, alert reliability, and security. Managing time-series data and building a scalable dashboard interface pushed us to optimize database queries and improve frontend responsiveness. One of the biggest learning outcomes was designing modular data pipelines that can adapt to multiple sensor types and environments, as well as building robust alert logic to avoid false positives or delayed responses.


## Outcome

EcoTrack Vision was successfully tested in a controlled environment and demonstrated its ability to provide accurate, timely insights into environmental conditions. The platform helped simulate smarter waste collection strategies, identify temperature anomalies, and improve environmental awareness among staff. With its real-time capabilities, role-based access, and scalable architecture, EcoTrack Vision is well-suited for municipalities, facilities management teams, and sustainability-driven organizations seeking smarter ways to monitor and manage environmental impact.
