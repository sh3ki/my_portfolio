## Challenges and Learnings

Building Premio involved creating a secure system that handled sensitive financial data while ensuring a frictionless user experience. Implementing document upload with proper validation and encryption presented technical challenges, as did building a real-time status tracking feature. Another key learning area was designing the workflow logic for loan officers, including application queues, filtering tools, and decision tracking. These challenges enhanced our expertise in secure web development, data privacy handling, and dynamic multi-role systems tailored to financial services.

## Outcome

Premio was successfully implemented and tested in a simulated loan application environment, where it streamlined the entire loan process—from submission to decision. The system significantly reduced the need for manual data entry and face-to-face interactions, resulting in faster approvals and improved user satisfaction. With its secure, scalable, and user-friendly design, Premio offers a powerful solution for banks, microfinance institutions, and auto dealerships seeking to digitize and accelerate their loan application processes.
