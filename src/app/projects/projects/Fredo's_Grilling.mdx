## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring smooth integration with hardware devices like the cash register and receipt printer, which required low-level command handling and cross-platform testing. Managing real-time updates across multiple users and roles using WebSockets also introduced complexity, particularly around performance and reliability. Additionally, building a responsive interface that works equally well on tablets and desktops involved careful UI/UX testing and component optimization. These challenges pushed deeper learning in Laravel’s queueing system, real-time communication layers, and hardware communication protocols.

## Outcome

The system is now actively used by Fredo’s Grilling business, significantly reducing order errors, speeding up service times, and giving admins clearer insight into daily operations. Staff found the tablet interface intuitive and fast, while the admin panel provides all the control needed to manage the business in real-time. The result is a more efficient, data-driven, and scalable restaurant operation.
