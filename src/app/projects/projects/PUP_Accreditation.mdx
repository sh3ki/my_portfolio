## Overview

PUP Accreditation System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to simplify and automate the document management process for academic accreditation at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Built to facilitate collaboration among faculty, reviewers, and administrators, the system enables secure uploading, review, and approval of accreditation documents. Featuring dedicated portals for faculty, reviewers, and admins, the platform supports role-based access control, real-time messaging, and multimedia file uploads, ensuring a transparent and efficient accreditation workflow. Admins can customize guest landing pages, assign user roles, and oversee all operations from a centralized dashboard. Developed using Laravel, PHP, React, TypeScript, and MySQL with Firebase Authentication, the system combines a powerful backend with an intuitive, responsive frontend to meet the complex demands of academic accreditation management.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating a seamless approval workflow while maintaining document integrity posed significant design challenges. Implementing real-time messaging and notifications required deep coordination between React frontend and Laravel backend with AJAX calls. Ensuring secure file and video uploads, coupled with efficient storage management on Firebase, demanded careful architecture and validation strategies. Role-based access control was critical to protect sensitive data and maintain proper authorization across diverse user roles. Additionally, building a customizable guest landing page tested flexibility in the admin interface design. These challenges enhanced proficiency in full-stack development, cloud integration, and secure multi-role system design.

## Outcome

The PUP Accreditation System was successfully completed as part of a capstone project, demonstrating significant improvements in document handling, review efficiency, and user collaboration. Faculty members can upload and track documents effortlessly, reviewers benefit from streamlined approval workflows, and admins maintain full operational control through an intuitive dashboard. The platformâ€™s responsive design and real-time features contribute to a modernized, scalable accreditation process that can be expanded and adapted for broader institutional needs.
