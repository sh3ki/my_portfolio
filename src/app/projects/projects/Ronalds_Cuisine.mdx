## Challenges and Learnings

Developing Ronald's Cuisine required building a tightly coordinated system that could handle multiple types of orders and service workflows in real time. Synchronizing customer orders with kitchen activity and delivery tracking presented technical challenges in managing live data updates. Designing a user interface that remained simple and intuitive while supporting complex backend logic for multiple user roles was also a key focus. Through overcoming these challenges, we strengthened our skills in full-stack development, asynchronous data handling, and real-world logistics implementation within web systems.

## Outcome

Ronald's Cuisine was successfully deployed in a simulated restaurant setting, demonstrating increased order accuracy, faster service, and improved customer satisfaction. The system helped reduce manual coordination between departments and offered a scalable foundation for restaurants aiming to digitize their services. With its responsive design, real-time updates, and robust backend support, Ronald's Cuisine is well-suited for restaurants, cafes, and food chains seeking to modernize and streamline their operations.
