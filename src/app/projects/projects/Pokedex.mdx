## Overview

Pokedex Trading System is a web-based platform designed for Pokémon enthusiasts to collect, search, and trade Pokémon with fellow trainers. Built using Laravel, React, and MySQL, the system provides a dynamic and interactive experience through dedicated portals for trainers and admins. Trainers can manage their personal Pokémon collections, search through a comprehensive Pokédex, and initiate fair trades with other users. Admins have full control over Pokémon data, including stats, availability, and system-wide management. With real-time updates, secure user authentication via Firebase, and a responsive interface, the system brings the excitement of trading and collecting Pokémon into a modern, browser-based application.

## Technologies Used


- **Laravel (PHP)**: Backend framework for business logic, trading logic, and API endpoints.
- **React + TypeScript**: Frontend framework for a fast, interactive, and responsive user interface.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing Pokémon data, user collections, and trade records.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For secure, scalable user login and session management.
- **AJAX**: For seamless, real-time communication between frontend and backend.
- **GitHub**: For version control, collaboration, and code management.


## Challenges and Learnings

Building a balanced and secure trading system required careful validation logic to prevent unfair exchanges and data manipulation. Integrating real-time search and dynamic updates with AJAX and React demanded clean state management and efficient API design. Managing large sets of Pokémon data and presenting it in a user-friendly Pokédex taught valuable lessons in performance optimization and UX design. Implementing Firebase Authentication also improved understanding of secure, scalable user session handling. Additionally, syncing data between trainer collections and the trading logic highlighted the importance of relational database structuring and consistent backend rules.
